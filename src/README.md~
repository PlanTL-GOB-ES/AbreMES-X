# AllieES code

This folder contains all the code used to create de AllieES corpus. The folders are structured as follows:

## Execution

The executable file "AllieES.jar" is the program you need to create your abbreviation-definition database. The executable needs one single parameter: the folder where the database will be stored. Before executing, you need to follow these simple steps:
- Create the folder manually
- Store inside that folder the following files: "JST_spa.txt" and "corpora_list.txt"

JST_spa.txt contains all Journal Subject Terms extracted from the Spanish edition of MeSH (Medical Subject Headings).
corpora_list.txt includes the folders where your corpora are stored. The file needs to have one corpus per line. For each line, use the following format: "corpus_name {TAB} corpus_folder"

Remember that your corpora must be in Dublin Core format only. Learn more about Dublin Core in the following website: http://dublincore.org/

One your output directory is ready, just type the following command in your terminal:

java -jar AllieES.jar OUTPUT_DIRECTORY

## Code folders

### abbreviation_extractors

Algorithms to extract abbreviations. Here we use the algorithm developed by Schwartz & Hearst[1].
Alternative algorithms should be added in this folder.

### corpora_readers

This folder contains the code to read the folders where the corpus are stored. The program reads XML files in Dublin Core format only. 

### elements

This folder contains the classes used for the generation of the database.

### main

Executable class.

### managers

The code in this folder manages the database to get co-abbreviations, and also to gather information about each article used to extract abbreviation-definition pairs.

### tabular_file_readers

The code in this folder get the information from different database files. One file per database class/file.

### tabular_files_writers

The code in this folder writes the information in the database. One file per database class/file.
